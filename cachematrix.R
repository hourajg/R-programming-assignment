# The makeCacheMatrix() function is a custom function that allows you to create a specialized matrix object. 
# This object has additional features that enable caching and retrieval of data. 
# Typically, this function is utilized when performing matrix calculations or computations that require repetitive calculations on the same matrix. 
# The main purpose of using makeCacheMatrix() is to enhance performance by storing intermediate results in a cache. 
# For instance, if you have a complex operation that involves calculating the inverse of a matrix multiple times, you can employ this function to save the inverse in the cache after it has been computed once. 
# As a result, subsequent requests for the inverse will avoid unnecessary calculations, leading to improved efficiency.

# "cacheSolve" is a function in RStudio that is used to calculate the inverse of a matrix and cache the result for future use. 
# It is particularly useful when working with large matrices, as the inverse calculation can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. 
# By caching the result, subsequent calls to "cacheSolve" with the same matrix can retrieve the pre-calculated inverse, saving computational time.
